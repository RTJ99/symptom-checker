Bandaging Guidelines
• Use clean, preferably sterile, dressings.
• Check circulation below the injury before and after applying a bandage. If circulation is reduced, loosen the bandage.
• If blood soaks through the bandage, place more dressings and another bandage on top. The dressing that is in contact with the wound should remain in place and not be removed.
 • Dressings and bandages should be kept clean and dry to decrease the risk of infection. Once bleeding is under control and the wound has begun to heal, dressings that become wet should be replaced with dry dressings.", "name": " Heavly bleeding wounds"}, {"__v": 0, "_id": "6450ec5a6ed1af34ef2a6cba", "condition": "60a7b4b3c9b0f40015a1b0a5", "description": "Partial Thickness Burns

Fully thickness burns:Chemical Burns
Chemical burns can be caused by a wet or dry caustic chemical. Use 
caution with dry caustic chemicals, as they may spread or react if they 
become wet.
What to Look For
• Redness
• Pain (may not be present in the
most severely burned areas due to
nerve damage)
• Possible swelling
• Blisters
• Charred or waxy, white flesh
Care
1. Wear protective equipment to avoid being burned yourself.
2. If there are dry chemicals present, brush them off the person’s
skin before flushing with water.
3. Flush the affected areas with large amounts of cool running
water for at least 15 minutes, or until EMS personnel arrive. Flush
the chemicals away from areas of the body that have not been
contaminated.

Special Considerations When Caring for Burns
Remember the following special considerations when providing care 
for burns:
• Don’t use ointments on partial or full thickness burns.
• Blisters are a natural cooling system. Leave them in place.
• Touch a burn only with sterile or clean dressings.
• Do not use absorbent cotton or pull clothes over any burned area.

Signs and symptoms that signal imminent childbirth include the 
following:
• Contractions that are 2 minutes apart or less
• The woman says that the baby is coming
• The woman feels the urge to push
• The woman feels like she needs to have a bowel movement
• The baby is crowning

what to do
1. Clear the area of unnecessary bystanders.
2. Help the woman into a position of comfort.
3. Create a clean birthing area by placing clean blankets
and/or towels under the woman. For the sake of privacy,
place a clean sheet or towel over the woman’s abdomen.
4. As the baby is being birthed:
• Support the head as it is
delivered. Do not push or
pull the baby.
• Once the shoulders emerge,
the rest of the baby will be
delivered very quickly.
• Newborns are slippery, so
hold the baby firmly but do
not squeeze him or her.
5. Position the baby face down and wipe any fluids or mucus away
from his or her mouth and nose.
6. Check the baby’s airway and breathing. Babies may not breathe
and cry immediately after they are born. Usually, actively drying
them with a towel will stimulate them to breathe and cry. If the
baby does not begin to breathe or cry following stimulation,
begin CPR.
7. Keep the baby warm by placing him or her directly onto the
mother’s chest and covering with a blanket or towel, or by
wrapping the baby in a clean towel or blanket.
8. Let the placenta and cord drop onto a clean towel and keep this
near the baby. Do not cut the cord. Handle the placenta and cord
as little as possible.
9. Record the time of birth.
10.If the mother is bleeding, you may need to apply gentle pressure
to any bleeding tears.
11. Provide continual care for both the mother and the baby until
EMS personnel arrive
